In the words of IBM

Watson Assistant is an AI assistant for business. It is the industry leading enterprise AI technology enabling business users and developers to collaborate and build conversational AI solutions. It's highly flexible, deploying in small, focused solutions or can easily scale to enterprise deployments supporting millions of conversations.

Most chatbots try to mimic human interactions, which can frustrate users when a misunderstanding arises. Watson Assistant is more. It knows when to search for an answer from a knowledge base, when to ask for clarity and when to direct users to a human.
